<objective>
Clinical research topic mining consultant. Input patient-level CSV or XLSX data, output structured paper topic report with 3-5 candidate topics.

**Does not perform statistical analysis or manuscript writing — only topic discovery.**
</objective>

<execution_context>
@./pipeline/workflows/data2idea.md
@./agents/topic-miner-agent.md
</execution_context>

<process>
Execute the data2idea workflow from @./pipeline/workflows/data2idea.md end-to-end.

The dedicated **topic-miner-agent** (@./agents/topic-miner-agent.md) handles execution:

1. **Data profiling**: Run data_profiler.py → variable inventory, distributions, missing patterns, study type prediction
2. **Literature scan**: PubMed search based on data profile → research gap analysis
3. **Topic generation**: 3-5 structured candidate topics with feasibility scores

After user selects a topic, guide them to use `clinpub` for full analysis pipeline.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Data profile generated (variable inventory, missing report, study type prediction)
- Literature scan completed with gap analysis
- 3-5 candidate topics with feasibility scores, variable mapping, and target journals
- User has selected a topic (or returned to refine)
</success_criteria>

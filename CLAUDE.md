# CLAUDE.md — clinpub

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the `clinpub` project.

## Overview

`clinpub` is a structured clinical data analysis and publication pipeline. It acts as a **senior medical statistician + academic writing consultant**, processing patient-level data through 5 phases to produce publication-ready manuscripts targeting SCI Q1/Q2 journals.

## Architecture

The project follows the GSD (Get Shit Done) layered architecture:

```
commands/clinpub/*.md → Thin entry points (user-facing)
agents/*.md            → Specialized AI agent role cards (7 agents)
pipeline/
  workflows/*.md       → Phase orchestration logic
  references/*.md      → Reference documents (standards, methods, patterns, gates)
  templates/*.md       → Study type templates + project config + verification
  contexts/*.md        → Context configurations
scripts/*.py           → Tool scripts (data profiling, literature search, PDF reading)
hooks/*.js/*.sh        → Claude Code hooks (workflow guard, phase boundary, prompt guard)
tests/                 → Test files
```

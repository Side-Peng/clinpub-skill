# ClinPub - Clinical Publication Pipeline

End-to-end clinical data analysis and publication pipeline. Adapts to any clinical research article type.

## Overview

ClinPub is a structured clinical data analysis and publication pipeline that acts as a senior medical statistician and academic writing consultant. Core pipeline Phase 0-3 processes patient-level data through initialization, data cleaning, adaptive statistical analysis, and IMRAD manuscript writing; standalone tools handle manuscript improvement, cover-letter generation, and post-submission reviewer response.

## Pipeline Phases

| Phase | Command | Purpose | Key Output |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| 0 | `clinpub:init` | Project initialization or import (target journal explicitly asked) | `project_config.yml` |
| 1 | `clinpub:data-prep` | Data cleaning and EDA | `cleaned.csv` |
| 2 | `clinpub:analysis` | Statistical analysis | `04_Outputs/` |
| 3 | `clinpub:writing` | IMRAD manuscript writing (core pipeline end) | `manuscript.md` |

## Standalone Tools

Invocable anytime the prerequisite exists (do not occupy a phase number):

| Tool | Purpose | Key Output |
|------|---------|------------|
| `clinpub:improving` | Self-review draft → revision plan → direct revision (text + analysis re-run) | updated `manuscript.md` |
| `clinpub:coverletter` | Tailored submission cover letter from target-journal requirements | `cover_letter.md` |
| `clinpub:review` | Post-submission: real reviewer comments → response letter + revision | `final/` |
| `clinpub:modify` | Modify completed analyses or add new analysis methods | updated `04_Outputs/` |
| `clinpub:data2idea` | Topic mining from data | idea report |
| `clinpub:milestone` | Phase gate verification | `MILESTONE.md` |

## Installation

### As Codex Plugin

```bash
# From local path (run from the repository root)
codex plugin install ./codex/clinpub

# From marketplace
codex plugin install clinpub
```

### Dependencies

**R**: dplyr, tidyr, stringr, readr, readxl, survival, lme4, glmnet, pROC, gtsummary, flextable, openxlsx, ggplot2, ggpubr, patchwork, survminer, ggsurvfit, ggsignif, here, fs, yaml, RColorBrewer, viridis

**Python**: pandas, numpy, requests, openpyxl (see `requirements.txt`)

**Environment Variables**:
- `NCBI_API_KEY` (optional, improves PubMed rate)
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` (Tavily search)
- `UNPAYWALL_EMAIL` (Unpaywall PDF access)

## Usage

```bash
# Start with Phase 0
clinpub:init

# After Phase 0 completes and user signs off, proceed to Phase 1
clinpub:data-prep

# Continue one phase at a time until the manuscript is drafted
clinpub:analysis
clinpub:writing

# After drafting, use standalone tools as needed
clinpub:improving
clinpub:coverletter
clinpub:review

# Topic mining from data
clinpub:data2idea <file>

# Check phase status
clinpub:milestone <N>

# Auto-advance to next step
clinpub:next-step

# Route to appropriate command
clinpub:do [intent]

# Modify analysis outputs or add new analysis methods
clinpub:modify [method ID]
```

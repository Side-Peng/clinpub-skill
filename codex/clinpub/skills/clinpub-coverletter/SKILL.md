Reads the target journal defined at initialization, gathers the journal's official submission requirements (author guidelines) via web search, then drafts a tailored cover letter. Falls back to journal-tier best practices if the web is unavailable. Standalone tool — invocable anytime a manuscript exists. Triggers: write cover letter, prepare submission letter."

# ClinPub Cover Letter

Produce a submission-ready cover letter tailored to the target journal:

1. **Resolve the target journal** from `project_config.yml` (`journal.name` / `project.target_journal`), set at initialization; ask the user if it is missing.
2. **Gather** the journal's official submission requirements and aims & scope from its website (web search + fetch), with graceful fallback to journal-tier best practices when the web is unavailable.
3. **Draft** a tailored cover letter (significance/fit, key findings, and the journal's required compliance statements) to `05_Manuscript/cover_letter.md`.

## Execution Context

- Workflow: `pipeline/workflows/coverletter.md`
- References: `pipeline/references/journal_standards.md`

## Process

Execute the coverletter workflow from `pipeline/workflows/coverletter.md` end-to-end.

Prerequisite: a manuscript exists (`05_Manuscript/manuscript.md`). If not, tell the user to run `clinpub:writing` first.

## Success Criteria

- Target journal resolved (asked if missing)
- Journal submission requirements gathered from the official site, or graceful fallback clearly noted
- Cover letter written to `05_Manuscript/cover_letter.md`, tailored to the journal's aims & scope
- All journal-required cover-letter elements and compliance statements included
- Key findings consistent with the manuscript; no overclaiming
- User-specific fields (editor name, dates, affiliations) clearly marked as placeholders

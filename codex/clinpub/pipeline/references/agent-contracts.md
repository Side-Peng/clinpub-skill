# Agent Contracts

> Each clinpub agent has a defined role, scope, inputs, outputs, and completion markers.

---

## Contract Structure

Each agent contract defines:

- **Role**: One-sentence summary of what the agent does
- **Scope**: What the agent is responsible for (and what it is NOT)
- **Inputs**: Files and context the agent reads
- **Outputs**: Files and artifacts the agent produces
- **Communication**: How the agent shares results with other agents
- **Completion markers**: Observable signs that the agent has finished its work

## Cross-Agent Communication Rules

1. **Filesystem-only**: Agents communicate through files, never direct messages
2. **No circular dependencies**: Agent A reads from Agent B's output, never vice versa
3. **Single writer per directory**: Each output directory has exactly one author agent
4. **Shared read, exclusive write**: Multiple agents can read `project_config.yml`, only the orchestrator writes to it
5. **State updates through orchestrator**: Agents do not update STATE.md directly; the orchestrator handles state transitions
6. **Manifest contract**: Each agent writes MANIFEST.yaml after completing its outputs. Downstream agents read and validate the manifest before consuming. See `pipeline/references/manifest-format.md`.

## Cross-Agent Read/Write Matrix

Shows which agent reads (R) and writes (W) to each directory. Agents only read from directories they have R access to and write to directories they have W access to.

| Agent \ Directory | `01_RawData` | `02_Preprocessed` | `03_AnalysisMethods` | `04_Outputs` | `05_Manuscript` | `Reference/` | `.clinpub/` | `idea/` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **analyst-agent** | R | W | W | W | - | - | - | - |
| **reference-agent** | - | - | - | - | - | W | - | - |
| **writer-agent** | - | - | R | R | W | R | - | - |
| **topic-miner-agent** | R | - | - | - | - | - | - | W |
| **clinpub-planner** | - | - | - | - | - | - | W | - |
| **clinpub-executor** | - | R | R | W | - | - | W | - |
| **clinpub-verifier** | - | R | R | R | R | R | R | - |
| **modify-agent** | - | R | W | W | R/W (patch only) | - | R | - |

**Rules:**
- `-` = no access (agent should not read from or write to this directory)
- **R** = read access (agent may read files from this directory)
- **W** = write access (agent may create or modify files in this directory; implies read access)
- **R/W (patch only)** = read access with limited write (may only patch numerical values and method descriptions, never rewrite entire sections)
- Multi-agent write to the same directory is NOT allowed (single writer per directory)
- Exception: `02_Preprocessed` is written by analyst-agent (Phase 1) and read by analyst-agent (Phase 2) — same agent, different phases
- Exception: `03_AnalysisMethods` and `04_Outputs` are written by analyst-agent (Phase 2) and modify-agent (post-Phase 2 modification) — different phases, no concurrent write conflict
- Exception: `05_Manuscript` may be patched (not rewritten) by modify-agent during cascade updates — limited to numerical value updates and method description patches in existing sections
- Exception: `04_Outputs/_figure_config.R` is written once by analyst-agent (Phase 2 setup) and sourced (read) by all method scripts — this is the shared figure configuration pattern, not a multi-writer conflict
